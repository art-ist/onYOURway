onYOURway - Mapping Framework
=============================

Developing a mapping platform based on JSON, Leaflet and OpenStreetMap to map locations and show regional- and topic-maps in a way that is easy to use and visually compelling.

To get started with the code have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/art-ist/onYOURway/wiki).
If you'd like to contribute or use the bits, please drop me a message.
Current development coordination we use a KanBan Board at [trello](https://trello.com/b/XPo8ruB8/kanban).
