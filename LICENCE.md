# Introduction

The license, we'll set MindForest is not yet decided.
But you can join the discussion [here](https://github.com/art-ist/onYOURway/issues/9).

The basic idea is: 
_if you are not using the tool to gain commercial profit, if you promote the common good, free and open science or personal freedom, you should be able to use MindForest freely and without cost. 
If you are instead gaining profit, personally or for your company, you should give something back to the community. This can be by contributing your enhancements, spreading the word, or of course by sharing some of the profit you make with those who invested their time, passion and knowledge to make it all possible and supporting the further development and enhancement of this tool_.


## Why not just CC or an OSI-Open Source License?

The reasons for not using a Creative Commons Licence are quite simple. As these licences are great for publishing creative work, 
they where not intended to be used for software and thus do not cover all the legal issues between the project and the consumers 
and even more between the project and its contributors.

So licences that transfer the ideas behind the creative commons licenses to the realm of software are to be explored.

OSI ... reasons to come.

## Candidates and Inspirations

We are currently investigating and discussing:
* [AGPL - Gnu Affero General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)
* [Peer Production License](http://p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production_License)

## How can I use the code/plattform until the license is final?

If you are considering to use the onYOURway mapping plattform in your project or whant to contribute, just drop a note to info@onyourway.at to get an individual licanse.
